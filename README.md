# Deep Dream Scripts and Notes

## Making Deep Dream Work on Video

1. Setup the instance using a pre-built AMI on Virgina (US East).

When using a pre-built AMI, most of the steps in the page above are no longer necessary.

2. Setup Docker and the GPU-enabled Caffe container. This is the actual container that we'll use but most of the scripts we need are in another container, which we'll install in step 3.

3. Setup the dockerized Deep Dream guide below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VISIONAI/clouddream.git
```

In the scripts, replace the image used by deepdream-compute with tleyden5iwx/caffe-gpu-master since the VISIONAI's container is NOT GPU-enabled.
However instead of using the provided visionai/clouddream docker image, I used the tleyden5iwx/caffe-gpu-master image

4. Modify deepdream.py by adding these lines:

```python
caffe.set_device(0
)
caffe.set_mode_gpu()
```

5. The caffe-gpu-master image, though it supports GPU via CUDA, doesnâ€™t have the needed Caffe model.

so you need to wget that into the /opt/caffe/models/bvlc_googlenet/ folder inside the container

```bash
cd /opt/caffe/models/bvlc_googlenet/
wget http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel
```

6. To get inside the docker file with GPU support and with the deepdream folder mounted properly:
```bash
docker run -ti --rm  --name deepdream-gpu --device /dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0 --device /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl --device /dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm -v ~/clouddream/deepdream:/opt/deepdream tleyden5iwx/caffe-gpu-master /bin/bash
```

7. To process the video, use process_video.sh in this repo.
